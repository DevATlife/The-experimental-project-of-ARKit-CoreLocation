Use CocoaPods to integrate ARKit-CoreLocation ProjectDent https://github.com/ProjectDent/ARKit-CoreLocation 
into your Xcode project by following below steps:


<br>

> - Create a new Xcode project type of (Single View App) 

> - Open Terminal then type ( cd ) then drag your project root folder into the Terminal and press return 

> - Once you are inside your project in the Terminal, type (pod init) this will initialize a pod file in your project. 

> - Open your project folder using finder then open the pod file using Brackets or Atom get that done then follow ProjectDent instructions. 


Be aware that whenever you add a third party library to your project then that requires you to open it through the use of xcworkspace file.
